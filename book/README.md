# Notes on Time Series Database, unpublished edition

The layout is subject to change, and need to merge w/ libtsdb-go

- [01 Overview](01-overview)
  - what is time series data and why we need time series database
- [02 Basic](02-basic)
  - [Primitive Types](02-basic/primitive/README.md)
    - [Endianess](02-basic/primitive/endianness.md) How to store larger than one byte value
    - [Integer](02-basic/primitive/integer.md) Unsigned and Signed Integer
    - float number and their machine representation (basic for working on compression)
  - statistic, distribution, random etc.
  - maybe information theory
? data model ? a dedicated chapter?
- 03 components (might flatten this)
  - overview
  - query language
    - complex query execution would also be interesting
    - SQL
    - continuous query, prometheus ppl also has an article about it
  - index (in memory and on disk?)
  - compression
  - storage
    - different backend, pros and cons
  - distribution
- 04 survey (remove it? or take a small part from the survey folder)
  - influxdb
  - prometheus, victoriametrics, thanos (and another one ... forgot the name from weaveworks)
  - m3db
  - akumuli, btrdb (both are tree like)
  - timescaledb (and others on pg, most of them are dead so ...)
  - druid alike (linkedin also got one)
  - graphite (and newer backends)
  - mysql
  - elasticsearch
  - crate (it looks pretty good, though it seems it is bought by some other company)
- 05 benchmark
  - components
    - workload generator
    - stats collector
    - basic math, distribution
    - historgram and lhdr (forgot what's the name ...)
  - existing tools, their pro can cons
- 06 application
  - iot
  - monitoring  
- 07 analysis (a.k.a ml a.k.a import ts as tf)
  - prediction
  - anomaly detection
- 08 tracing (keep it in this repo for now)
- 09 OLAP, MPP
- 10 How we (or maybe just me...) built Xephon-K (not yet)
  - failure injection and correctness validation
  - continuous benchmark
