## Background

The last commit is 1 month ago where I sorted the roadmap for the book.
As other projects like BenchHub and gegecece are moving along (slowly), it's time to spend some time on TSDB.

Although Notes On TSDB (ntsdb) is a book, it is also a project that needs to be managed.
So it will follow the WIP project and doc management model originated from gegecece.

- doc is for writing log and project management
- book is the actual book
- survey is top level directory

## Implementation

See [milestones](../milestones)
